# Leveraging Deep Learning for Machine Translation in Analyzing Psychological Factors in Physical Education and Sport

## Abstract
Machine translation has evolved into a cornerstone of natural language processing, leveraging deep learning to enhance semantic and syntactic alignment across diverse languages. Despite these advancements, challenges such as low-resource languages, domain variability, and contextual ambiguity persist. To address these limitations, we present a novel framework incorporating a dynamic attention mechanism and hierarchical encoding to capture multi-granular linguistic features and long-distance dependencies effectively. The framework introduces a cross-lingual alignment module to facilitate knowledge transfer between languages, improving translation quality for low-resource settings. To further enhance performance, we propose a context-aware training strategy employing dynamic curriculum learning, adaptive domain adaptation, and uncertainty-driven optimization. This strategy ensures robust and adaptable learning across varied linguistic and domain contexts. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in translation accuracy, fluency, and domain adaptability, establishing a state-of-the-art approach for machine translation tasks.
